            <h3 class="card-title" style="color: red;">Sweet Mangoes</h3>
            <p class="card-text">A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree
                Mangifera indica. It is
                believed to have originated in
                the region between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India.[1] M. indica has been
                cultivated in South
                and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two types of modern mango cultivars: the "Indian
                type" and the
                "Southeast Asian type".[2][3] Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible fruits that are
                also called
                "mangoes", the majority of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion.[4]

                Worldwide, there are several hundred cultivars of mango. Depending on the cultivar, mango fruit varies
                in size, shape,
                sweetness, skin color, and flesh color which may be pale yellow, gold, green, or orange.[1] Mango is the
                national fruit
                of India, Pakistan and the Philippines,[5][6] while the mango tree is the national tree of
                Bangladesh.<br>
                Mango trees grow to 30–40 metres (98–131 feet) tall, with a crown radius of 10–15 m (33–49 ft). The
                trees are
                long-lived, as some specimens still fruit after 300 years.[10]

                In deep soil, the taproot descends to a depth of 6 m (20 ft), with profuse, wide-spreading feeder roots
                and anchor roots
                penetrating deeply into the soil.[1] The leaves are evergreen, alternate, simple, 15–35 centimetres
                (6–14 inches) long,
                and 6–16 cm (2+1⁄2–6+1⁄2 in) broad; when the leaves are young they are orange-pink, rapidly changing to
                a dark, glossy
                red, then dark green as they mature.[1] The flowers are produced in terminal panicles 10–40 cm (4–15+1⁄2
                in) long; each
                flower is small and white with five petals 5–10 millimetres (3⁄16–3⁄8 in) long, with a mild, sweet
                fragrance.[1] Over
                500 varieties of mangoes are known,[1] many of which ripen in summer, while some give a double crop.[11]
                The fruit takes
                four to five months from flowering to ripen.[1]

                The ripe fruit varies according to cultivar in size, shape, color, sweetness, and eating quality.[1]
                Depending on the
                cultivar, fruits are variously yellow, orange, red, or green.[1] The fruit has a single flat, oblong pit
                that can be
                fibrous or hairy on the surface, and does not separate easily from the pulp.[1] The fruits may be
                somewhat round, oval,
                or kidney-shaped, ranging from 5–25 centimetres (2–10 in) in length and from 140 grams (5 oz) to 2
                kilograms (5 lb) in
                weight per individual fruit.[1] The skin is leather-like, waxy, smooth, and fragrant, with color ranging
                from green to
                yellow, yellow-orange, yellow-red, or blushed with various shades of red, purple, pink or yellow when
                fully ripe.[1]

                Ripe intact mangoes give off a distinctive resinous, sweet smell.[1] Inside the pit 1–2 mm (0.039–0.079
                in) thick is a
                thin lining covering a single seed, 4–7 cm (1.6–2.8 in) long. Mangoes have recalcitrant seeds which do
                not survive
                freezing and drying.[12] Mango trees grow readily from seeds, with germination success highest when
                seeds are obtained
                from mature fruits.

            <h3 class="card-title" style="color: blue;">Tasty Apples</h3>
            <p class="card-text">An apple is an edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus
                domestica). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide and are
                the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild
                ancestor, Malus
                sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe and
                were brought to
                North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many
                cultures, including
                Norse, Greek, and European Christian tradition.

                Apples grown from seed tend to be very different from those of their parents, and the resultant fruit
                frequently lacks
                desired characteristics. Generally, apple cultivars are propagated by clonal grafting onto rootstocks.
                Apple trees grown
                without rootstocks tend to be larger and much slower to fruit after planting. Rootstocks are used to
                control the speed
                of growth and the size of the resulting tree, allowing for easier harvesting.

                There are more than 7,500 known cultivars of apples. Different cultivars are bred for various tastes and
                uses, including
                cooking, eating raw, and cider production. Trees and fruit are prone to a number of fungal, bacterial,
                and pest
                problems, which can be controlled by a number of organic and non-organic means. In 2010, the fruit's
                genome was
                sequenced as part of research on disease control and selective breeding in apple production.

                Worldwide production of apples in 2018 was 86 million tonnes, with China accounting for nearly half of
                the total<br>
                The apple is a deciduous tree, generally standing 2 to 4.5 m (6 to 15 ft) tall in cultivation and up to
                9 m (30 ft) in
                the wild. When cultivated, the size, shape and branch density are determined by rootstock selection and
                trimming method.
                The leaves are alternately arranged dark green-colored simple ovals with serrated margins and slightly
                downy
                undersides.[5]


                Apple blossom
                Blossoms are produced in spring simultaneously with the budding of the leaves and are produced on spurs
                and some long
                shoots. The 3 to 4 cm (1 to 1+1⁄2 in) flowers are white with a pink tinge that gradually fades, five
                petaled, with an
                inflorescence consisting of a cyme with 4–6 flowers. The central flower of the inflorescence is called
                the "king bloom";
                it opens first and can develop a larger fruit.[5][6]

                The fruit is a pome that matures in late summer or autumn, and cultivars exist in a wide range of sizes.
                Commercial
                growers aim to produce an apple that is 7 to 8.5 cm (2+3⁄4 to 3+1⁄4 in) in diameter, due to market
                preference. Some
                consumers, especially those in Japan, prefer a larger apple, while apples below 5.5 cm (2+1⁄4 in) are
                generally used for
                making juice and have little fresh market value. The skin of ripe apples is generally red, yellow,
                green, pink, or
                russetted, though many bi- or tri-colored cultivars may be found.[7] The skin may also be wholly or
                partly russeted i.e.
                rough and brown. The skin is covered in a protective layer of epicuticular wax.[8] The exocarp (flesh)
                is generally pale
                yellowish-white,[7] though pink, yellow or green exocarps also occur.

            <p class="card-text">Guava (/ˈɡwɑːvə/)[1] is a common tropical fruit cultivated in
                many tropical and
                subtropical regions.[2] The common guava
                Psidium guajava (lemon guava, apple guava) is a small tree in the myrtle family (Myrtaceae), native to
                Mexico, Central
                America, the Caribbean and northern South America.[2] The name guava is also given to some other species
                in the genus
                Psidium such as strawberry guava (Psidium cattleyanum) and to the pineapple guava, Feijoa sellowiana. In
                2019, 55
                million tonnes of guavas were produced worldwide, led by India with 45% of the total. Botanically,
                guavas are berries.<br>
                Guavas originated from an area thought to extend from Mexico, Central America or northern South America
                throughout the
                Caribbean region.[2][6][7] Archaeological sites in Peru yielded evidence of guava cultivation as early
                as 2500 BCE.[7]

                Guava was adopted as a crop in subtropical and tropical Asia, parts of the United States (from Tennessee
                and North
                Carolina, southward, as well as the west and Hawaii), tropical Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and
                Oceania.[6]
                Guavas were introduced to Florida, US in the 19th century[2] and are grown there as far north as
                Sarasota, Chipley,
                Waldo and Fort Pierce. However, they are a primary host of the Caribbean fruit fly and must be protected
                against
                infestation in areas of Florida where this pest is present.[8]

                Guavas are cultivated in many tropical and subtropical countries.[2][6] Several species are grown
                commercially; apple
                guava and its cultivars are those most commonly traded internationally.[2] Guavas also grow in
                southwestern Europe,
                specifically the Costa del Sol on Málaga, (Spain) and Greece where guavas have been commercially grown
                since the middle
                of the 20th century and they proliferate as cultivars.[6] Mature trees of most species are fairly
                cold-hardy and can
                survive temperatures slightly colder than −4 °C (25 °F) for short periods of time, but younger plants
                will likely freeze
                to the ground.[9]

                Guavas are of interest to home growers in subtropical areas as one of the few tropical fruits that can
                grow to fruiting
                size in pots indoors. When grown from seed, guava trees can bear fruit in two years, and can continue to
                do so for forty
                years.

            <p class="card-text">The pomegranate (Punica granatum) is a fruit-bearing deciduous
                shrub in the family Lythraceae, subfamily Punicoideae,
                that grows between 5 and 10 m (16 and 33 ft) tall.


                Young pomegranate in Side, Turkey
                The pomegranate was originally described throughout the Mediterranean region. It was introduced into
                Spanish America in
                the late 16th century and into California by Spanish settlers in 1769.[4]

                The fruit is typically in season in the Southern Hemisphere from March to May, and in the Northern
                Hemisphere from
                September to February.[5][6] As intact sarcotestas or juice, pomegranates are used in baking, cooking,
                juice blends,
                meal garnishes, smoothies, and alcoholic beverages, such as cocktails and wine.

                Pomegranates are widely cultivated throughout the Middle East and Caucasus region, north and tropical
                Africa, Iran,
                Armenia, the Indian subcontinent, Central Asia, the drier parts of Southeast Asia, and the Mediterranean
                Basin.</p>
